Welcome to StackEdit!
===================


Hey! I'm your first Markdown document in **StackEdit**[^stackedit]. Don't delete me, I'm very helpful! I can be recovered anyway in the **Utils** tab of the <i class="icon-cog"></i> **Settings** dialog.

StackEdit stores your documents in your browser, which means all your documents are automatically saved locally and are accessible **offline!**

StackEdit can be combined with <i class="icon-provider-gdrive"></i> **Google Drive** and <i class="icon-provider-dropbox"></i> **Dropbox** to have your documents saved in the *Cloud*. The synchronization mechanism takes care of uploading your modifications or downloading the latest version of your documents.
